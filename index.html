              Voter turnout makes or breaks political campaigns in the United States. It is no easy task to get people to the polls, especially with some states imposing strict voting laws.
              These laws are often interpretted to be voter suppression laws, and the state of Georgia is no stranger to controversial voting laws. Since 2010, the office of state Governor
              Brian Kemp has revoked over 1.4 million voter's registrations. Voters lose their registration if they do not vote in an election, and face additional barriers with restrictive
              ID and hand-writing laws. Georgia historically is among the states with the lowest voter turnout, with their average turnout sitting at 59%. Between 2008 - 2016,
              voting laws in Atlanta, Georgia remained the same, however turnout grew on the precinct level and across the city, even in elections for smaller offices. Despite voting laws
              that many consider to be "strict" relative to other states, how does Georgia continue to grow turnout? Part of the answer lies in changing campaign strategies. The 2016 Presidential
              election, while controversial, stands out due to its huge increase in turnout relative to previous years with 76% voter turnout across the state.
              The increase seen in Atlanta was predominantly amongst democrats, who made up 80-90% of votes cast within city limits. Whether it was fear or inspiration that drove new voters to the
              polls, it worked! Turnout data in this project is sourced from the Georgia Attorney General. </div>
